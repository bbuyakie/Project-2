	<p>HIV diagnoses are decreasing across the five boroughs, but amidst city and state efforts to increase equal accessibility for HIV medical care, there remain disparities in poor communities of color and transgender people.</p> 

	<p>According to the 2018 HIV Surveillance Annual Report, 1,917 New Yorkers were diagnosed with HIV, down from 2,157 in 2017. The most pronounced decreases were among Whites, Asian/Pacific Islanders, men who report having sex with men and people with a history of injection drug use.</p>

	<p>Since 2013, Brooklyn has reported more newly diagnosed cases of HIV than any borough, but in 2018, it saw the largest change in the city with 90 fewer diagnoses from 2017.</p>

	<p>“It’s important to note that factors including stigma, discrimination, socio-economic challenges and poverty create barriers for populations to access cultural competent care,” Urbano said. “You see a trend that communities of color, tend to have higher diagnosis rate.”</p>
